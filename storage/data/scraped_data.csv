2 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024MAINTAINING GOOD EAR HEALTH
Your baby can hear with one ear—an important asset to protect. However, three 
key factors might affect their hearing during their life.
Ear wax
The ear naturally produces wax (or cerumen) to protect the ear canal. Typically, 
the ears clean themselves. The wax and dirt move away from the eardrum to the 
opening of the ear canal, where you can remove the wax with a damp cloth. 
However, sometimes wax builds up and blocks sound from reaching the 
eardrum. This can make it harder for your child with UHL to hear well. A wax 
build-up in young children is usually only noticed during routine ear 
examinations at the doctor or audiologist.
Ear drops that soften the wax are available from the pharmacy, which may be all 
that is needed to remove the wax. Always consult your family doctor (GP) if 
you’re concerned. 
Do not insert any foreign objects into the ear canal!
Avoid using ear candling which is both ineffective 
and dangerous.
Ear infections
Ear infections are common in young children and can cause temporary hearing 
loss and impact on speech development and learning.
Ear infections can occur in the outer ear (otitis externa) or the middle ear (otitis 
media). Outer ear infections are usually painful and may cause fever. In contrast, 
middle ear infections can lead to fluid build-up behind the eardrum, affecting the 
child's hearing.  
Otitis media with effusion or 'glue ear' occurs when fluid remains trapped behind 
the eardrum. A child with glue ear may have no symptoms, but the doctor can 
see the fluid during an ear examination. If the fluid remains in the middle ear for 
a long time or returns frequently, it can affect hearing.
Sound Waves | 3
Preventing ear infections
You can reduce your child's risk of ear infections.
• Immunise against pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal infections are a  
 major cause of otitis media. Vaccination for pneumococcal disease is part  
 of the routine immunisation schedule for babies at 2, 4 and 12 months old  
 (3 doses total) and is free for all Australian children.
• Practice good hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the germs that cause  
 colds and flu.
• Avoid exposing your child to cigarette smoke, as it increases the risk of ear  
 infections15.
Treating ear infections
Mild infections can often be managed with pain relievers like paracetamol. 
However, consult your family doctor if your child has a high fever, severe earache, 
or persistent ear discharge.
If you are worried about your child's hearing, arrange an appointment with your 
family doctor. Your doctor will examine your child's ears and should be able to 
tell if glue ear is present. If there is any pain or sign of infection, your GP may 
prescribe antibiotics. Your GP may want to wait to see if the glue ear clears up by 
itself before referring your child to an ENT specialist.
4 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Noise
Noise-induced hearing loss is becoming more common, especially due to loud 
leisure activities. It's important to understand that the effect of noise on hearing 
is cumulative - factors like frequency of exposure, duration, and intensity can 
cause damage over time. 
Protecting you and your child from noise
Lead by example! Children learn from observing their parents, so you should 
always use safe listening practices. 
• Educate your child from the early years on the importance of ear   
 protection.
• Always wear hearing protectors when carrying out noisy tasks at home and  
 help to develop good habits in your children from a young age.
• Turn down the volume when listening to music in a confined space.
• Turn down the volume on personal stereo headsets. Smartphones let you  
 set a safe listening limit in settings. The volume of a personal headsets  
 should be at a level where you can still hear someone speaking to you an  
 arm's length away. 
• Using noise-cancelling headphones can help eliminate external   
 background noise and allow the MP3 player to be played at lower volume.
Sound Waves | 5ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN 
WITH UNILATERAL HEARING LOSS TO 
HEAR MORE EFFECTIVELY
Children with UHL often develop and use various adaptive strategies to enhance 
their hearing and communication abilities. These strategies help them cope with 
the challenges of having reduced hearing in one ear and make the most of their 
available hearing. You can support your child with UHL to develop these 
adaptive strategies from the outset through modelling the behaviours when 
interacting with your child.
Optimal seating and positioning
Car trips: Placing your child’s car seat so their affected ear is alongside the 
window will help them hear the other people in the car with their good ear.
Social interactions: When interacting with peers or in group settings, 
children can place themselves so their good ear is closest to the person 
speaking.

 Inclusive education policy
Version : 1.3 | Version effective : 10/08/2021
Audience
The Inclusive education policy applies department-wide including all state schools and educational settings.
Purpose
 This policy sets out the Department of Education ’s (the department ’s) commitment to continue to work towards a 
more inclusive state education system and the principles, which will guide that work. 
Policy statement
The department commits to continuing our journey towards a more inclusive education system at policy and 
regional levels, and as part of our everyday practice in schools, educational settings and classrooms.
Inclusive education means that students can access and fully participate in learning, alongside their similar-aged 
peers, supported by reasonable adjustments and teaching strategies tailored to meet their individual needs.
Inclusion is embedded in all aspects of school life, and is supported by culture, policies and every day practices.
Inclusive education differs from the following approaches and practices in significant ways:
Integration — students are placed in schools or educational settings with their similar-aged peers but 
adjustments are not made to meet their individual needs. This limits their ability to fully access or participate
in learning. Integration is not necessarily a step towards inclusion.
Segregation — students learn in separate environments, designed or used to respond to their particular 
needs or impairment, in isolation from other students.
Exclusion — students are unable to access any form of education.
The department ’s commitment to inclusive education
We have high expectations of all students, recognising that, with the right support, all students can succeed.
Our commitment means that children and young people across Queensland, from all social, cultural, community 
and family backgrounds, and of all identities and all abilities can:
attend their local state school and education centre and be welcomed
Page 2 of 6
Uncontrolled copy . Refer to the Department of Education Policy and Procedure Register at 
https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/pp/inclusive-education-policy  to ensure you have the most  current version of this document.
access and participate in a high-quality education and fully engage in the curriculum alongside their similar-
aged peers
learn in a safe and supportive environment, free from bullying, discrimination or harassment
achieve academically and socially with reasonable adjustments and supports tailored to meet their learning 
needs.
The department will continue to offer parents the choice of enrolling their child, who meets set criteria in highly 
individualised programs, including through special schools and academies .
Principles
The department ’s work towards a more inclusive state education system will be guided by nine principles adapted 
from the United Nations ’ nine core features for inclusive education.
A system-wide approach
Inclusive education is implemented systemically, based on evidence, across the department including in schools 
and other educational settings. We promote and develop policies, programs and practices to remove barriers and 
promote inclusive education across the department and within local school communities.
Committed leaders
Leaders, at all levels within the department, across regions and local school communities, commit to and are 
accountable for implementing inclusive education. They promote a culture and shared values that remove barriers 
and support inclusion.
Whole of school
Every member of the school community, including teachers, support staff, volunteers, families and students, works 
collaboratively to ensure students can access and participate in all aspects of school life. Curriculum is provided to 
all students in ways that are age appropriate and responsive to diverse learning needs.
Collaboration with students, families and the community
We work with students, parents and caregivers, and other organisations, including teacher and professional 
associations, as respected and valued partners in inclusive education. We support students, parents, caregivers 
and families to have a voice and be heard. Their views are considered in decision making at all levels.
Respecting and valuing diversity
All students and families feel and are welcome, respected, included and safe at our state schools. We embrace 
and make visible diversity as a strength and support respectful relationships within the school community, and 
between students. We address the different barriers experienced by students and develop strategies and plans to 
support inclusive education for our diverse student population.

Early Intervention & 
Education for Deaf and 
Hard of Hearing Children
Addressing challenges in pursuit of better outcomes
Foreword
Early intervention and education for deaf and hard of hearing children have 
always been vitally important but vexed issues.  Deaf Australia has been advocating 
in the interests of deaf and hard of hearing children since the organisation was 
established in 1986, and while we have seen improvements in some areas, on the 
whole early intervention and education have remained a challenge.
At our national conference in May 2011, 
education was identified as a priority for 
Deaf Australia. The community is concerned 
and frustrated that early intervention and 
education programs are still problematic. 
Deaf and hard of hearing people and their 
families also felt very strongly that the system 
is not listening to them. 
Deaf Australia organised a summit in 
November 2012 to give the community an 
opportunity to be heard. While politicians, 
academics and educators made an important 
contribution and provided informative 
presentations, the primary purpose was to 
hear from people at the coal face, on the 
lived experience of early intervention and 
school education. We asked participants to 
consider four basic questions:
1 What has worked for you?
2 What has not worked?
3 What needs to change? 
4 What can we do to help make this 
change happen? Many people came together at the summit 
and shared poignant and uplifting stories. We 
thank them for their honesty and willingness 
to share their experiences, wisdom and 
ideas with us. Deaf Australia gratefully 
acknowledges the funding and ongoing 
support provided by the Department of 
Families, Housing, Community Services and 
Indigenous Affair.
We also thank the summit facilitators: Leonie 
Jackson, Catherine Clark and Sue Izard; and 
Grant Thornton who generously donated 
their time and resources to assist us in this 
documentation. 
If the summit did one thing, it was to 
remind us all that there is great diversity 
among deaf and hard of hearing children 
and their families and there is no ‘one size fits 
all’ approach. It also confirmed that Auslan 
and the Deaf community are important 
components of early intervention and school 
education, and that our systems need to 
change to incorporate these elements to 
ensure parents, families and children are 
given greater choice. Based on what our summit participants 
told us, this report gives us a framework 
for our ongoing work towards better early 
intervention and school education for deaf 
and hard of hearing children. We encourage 
all summit participants, our partners, and 
leading educators to also feel an ‘ownership’ 
of this report and the strategies it sets out. 
This is so that we can all continue to work 
together on achieving the necessary changes 
identified at the summit. Deaf Australia 
cannot do it alone; we need all stakeholders 
to continue to work with us. Everyone’s 
contribution to the process is important and 
deeply appreciated.

1  Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children
Foreword
On the 29th and 30th of November, 2012, Deaf Australia held 
a national conference on Early Intervention & Education for 
Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children.
The conference was attended by people 
from all walks of life, with a diverse array of 
rich presentations and discussions. While 
politicians, academics and educators all 
presented, some of the most poignant and 
powerful stories came from those with direct 
experience, the parents of deaf children.
Clear themes came through all the 
discussion:
•	Real choice for children and their parents,
•	A recognition of the importance of Auslan
•	Respect for deaf culture 
•	More information 
This paper documents the rich discussions of 
the conference and finishes with an Action 
Plan for Deaf Australia.This decade will see more fundamental 
change in both the disability and not-for-
profit sector than in any previous time. 
More than ever organisations such as Deaf 
Australia need to be a key participant in the 
greater societal and political discourse on 
matters relating to the deaf community. 
If we want to ensure that there is no 
difference in life outcomes for deaf children 
when compared to their hearing peers, then 
the importance of early intervention and 
education for Deaf Australia becomes self-
evident. Deaf Australia can play a vital role in 
assuring that young deaf people have choice 
and access to the appropriate supports.

 Healthy Hearing Program Minimum Stan dards of Practice  
Why a Queensland approach to Minimum Standards of Practice ? 
 
The introduction of universal newborn hearing screening in Queensland has resulted in early 
diagnosis of hearing impairment in approximately 120 infants each year. It is widely acknowledged 
that delays in identification and treatment of permanent childhood hearing impairment may profoundly 
affect quality of life in terms of communication development, language acquisition, social and 
emotional development, and education and employment prospects1. There is universal agreement 
that access to , and engagement with,  early interventi on optimises the communication and 
developmental outcomes of children who are deaf or hard of hearing.   
 
In Queensland, following a hearing loss diagnosis, children and their families are offered a range of 
early intervention programs that cover the communication spectrum.  Although some of these early 
intervention programs have developed assessment and treatment guidelines for children who are 
deaf or hard of hearing, these are not standard across organisations. This results in children with the 
same diagnoses potentially receiving different levels of service depending on the organisation they 
attend.  
 
Queensland Health’s Guidelines for Working with People who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (from the 
Mental Health Services department) discusses the terms “deaf”, “Deaf”, “culturally deaf” and “hard of 
hearing” in detail. For the purposes of the Queensland Minimum Standards of Practice,  the term  “deaf 
or hard of hearing”  encompasses those who identify as culturally deaf and belong to the Deaf 
community, as w ell as  those who have a permanent hearing loss and identify primarily with the 
mainstream hearing culture10,11,12. 
 
The Health Hearing Early Intervention Working Group ( HH-EIWG) was established in September 
2012, with the purpose of discussing professional  issues relevant to the provision of early intervention 
for children who are deaf or hard of hearing in Queensland. Goals of the HH-EIWG have included 
developing minimum standards of practice and clinical benchmarks for ea",True,PDF
